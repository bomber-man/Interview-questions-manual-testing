Use this file as a study or documentation reference for interview preparation. These questions and answers are written with practical examples and clear explanations.

---

### 1. What is Manual Testing?
Manual Testing is the process of testing software manually without using automation tools. Testers execute test cases based on requirements and report bugs if found.

**Example:** A tester manually checks the login page by entering valid and invalid credentials to verify behavior.

---

### 2. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?
- **Verification**: Ensures the product is built correctly according to design specifications.
- **Validation**: Ensures the product meets user needs and requirements.

**Example:**  
- Verification: Reviewing design documents.  
- Validation: Testing the actual login feature to confirm it works.

---

### 3. What are the different levels of testing?
1. **Unit Testing** â€“ Done by developers on individual components.
2. **Integration Testing** â€“ Checks data flow between modules.
3. **System Testing** â€“ Entire system is tested as a whole.
4. **Acceptance Testing** â€“ Verifies if the system meets business needs.

---

### 4. What is a Test Case?
A Test Case is a set of steps with test data, expected results, and actual outcomes to verify a feature.

**Example:**  
- Title: Login with valid credentials  
- Step: Enter correct username/password  
- Expected: Redirect to dashboard

---

### 5. What is a Test Scenario?
A Test Scenario is a high-level statement of what needs to be tested.

**Example:**  
- Scenario: Test login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.

---

### 6. What is a Bug, Defect, and Error?
- **Error**: Human mistake in code/design.
- **Defect**: Mismatch found during testing.
- **Bug**: Confirmed defect accepted by dev team.

---

### 7. What is the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?
STLC defines the phases followed by QA teams:  
1. Requirement Analysis  
2. Test Planning  
3. Test Case Design  
4. Test Environment Setup  
5. Test Execution  
6. Test Closure

---

### 8. What is a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)?
RTM maps requirements to test cases ensuring all functionalities are covered.

**Example:**  
Requirement: "User can reset password"  
Linked Test Case IDs: TC_03, TC_04

---

### 9. What is Regression Testing?
Testing unchanged parts of the application to ensure recent changes haven't broken existing functionality.

---

### 10. What is Smoke Testing?
Initial testing to ensure basic application functions work.

**Example:**  
Can you open the app? Can you login? If not, testing stops.

---

### 11. What is Sanity Testing?
Sanity testing is focused testing to verify a bug fix or new feature quickly.

**Example:**  
After fixing a logout bug, test only logout functionality.

---

### 12. What is Exploratory Testing?
Simultaneously learning and testing the application without predefined test cases.

---

### 13. What is Ad-hoc Testing?
Unstructured testing without any planning or documentation.

---

### 14. What is the difference between Test Case and Test Script?
- **Test Case**: Manual instructions
- **Test Script**: Code-based automation

---

### 15. What is Defect Life Cycle?
Stages:  
New â†’ Assigned â†’ Open â†’ Retest â†’ Verified â†’ Closed / Reopen â†’ Deferred

---

### 16. What is Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)?
Test at edge boundaries.

**Example:**  
Field accepts 1â€“100  
Test with 0, 1, 100, 101

---

### 17. What is Equivalence Partitioning?
Divides data into valid/invalid partitions.

**Example:**  
Age field (18â€“60):  
Valid: 30  
Invalid: 15, 65

---

### 18. What is Usability Testing?
Testing UI, accessibility, and user-friendliness.

---

### 19. What is Acceptance Testing?
Final level testing to validate business requirements.

**Example:**  
Client verifies invoice generation works correctly.

---

### 20. What are Test Deliverables?
Documents created during testing:  
Test Plan, Test Cases, Bug Reports, Test Summary, RTM, etc.

---

### 21. Difference Between Functional and Non-Functional Testing
- **Functional**: What the system does (login, payment)
- **Non-Functional**: How the system behaves (load, performance)

---

### 22. What Qualities Make a Good Tester?
- Attention to detail  
- Analytical thinking  
- Communication  
- Curiosity  
- Documentation skills

---

### 23. What is Compatibility Testing?
Testing app across browsers, devices, OS.

---

### 24. What is Localization and Globalization Testing?
- **Localization**: Check for region-specific formats, translations.
- **Globalization**: App supports all cultures (date, currency).

---

### 25. What is a Test Plan?
A detailed document describing scope, approach, resources, schedule, and responsibilities in testing.

---

### 26. What is a Test Summary Report?
Document showing execution stats, pass/fail count, open bugs, coverage, and conclusion.

---

### 27. Positive vs Negative Testing?
- **Positive**: Valid input to confirm correct behavior.  
- **Negative**: Invalid input to check error handling.

---

### 28. What is End-to-End Testing?
Test complete workflow from start to end as an end-user.

**Example:**  
Login â†’ Search Product â†’ Add to Cart â†’ Checkout â†’ Order Confirmation

---

### 29. What is Test Environment?
Setup of software/hardware/network where QA executes tests.

---

### 30. Difference Between QA and QC?
- **QA** (Quality Assurance): Process-oriented; preventive  
- **QC** (Quality Control): Product-oriented; detects bugs

---

> ğŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Keep practicing by creating your own test cases based on real websites or apps.
